# This is a test data file for test.rb. Blank lines and comment lines
# (those starting with '#') are ignored. Data lines alternate between
# test data and expected results.
#
# Results are strings obtained by parsing the data line, which returns
# an array, and printing that array joined with '*'. That is,
#
#	array = parse_data_line()
#	results = array.join('*')
